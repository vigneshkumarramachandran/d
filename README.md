World Bicycle Day

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Not to be confused with "Bicycle Day", the observance of the history of LSD.

Founding
Professor Leszek Sibilski (who is a Polish social scientist working in the United States) led a grassroots campaign with his sociology class to promote a UN Resolution for World Bicycle Day, eventually gaining the support of Turkmenistan and 56 other countries.[3][2][4] The original UN Blue and White #June3WorldBicycleDay logo was designed by Isaac Feld and the accompanying animation was done by Professor John E. Swanson. It depicts bicyclists of various types riding around the globe. At the bottom of the logo is the hashtag #June3WorldBicycleDay. The main message is to show that the bicycle belongs to and serves all of humanity.[5]
